### Hi there 👋

Hey there! I'm Giovanni..Gio or Joe for short, and I like to think of myself as a tech enthusiast with a knack for making complex things work seamlessly. Currently immersed in the world of AI, design systems and micro frontends, I thrive on the excitement of learning and diving deep into a myriad of tech domains.

Easy-going by nature, I believe in fostering a collaborative and innovative atmosphere within my team. Whether I'm geeking out over Progressive Web Apps, delving into the intricacies of automation testing or messing with AI, or exploring the realms of DevOps, I find joy in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Beyond the keyboard and code, you'll find me balancing life as a proud father to three little humans and two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. And yes, I've got the honor of being married to the most beautiful woman in the world.

When not navigating the digital realm, I love casting a line for some fishing, hitting the greens for a round of golf, camping/caravaning under the stars, or carving down snowy slopes on skis.

Feel free to dive into the tech talk with me, share fishing stories, or just connect over a virtual cup of coffee. Let's navigate the exciting intersection of technology, family, and the great outdoors together.
